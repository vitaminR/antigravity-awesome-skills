# SPEC0 — AntiGravity

## Repo structure (high level)

- `skills/` contains skill definitions and supporting scripts.
- `CATALOG.md` and `skills_index.json` are discovery entry points.
- `scripts/` contains utility scripts used by skills.

## Conventions

- Prefer dry-run modes.
- Avoid destructive defaults.
