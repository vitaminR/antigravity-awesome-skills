# AntiGravity Cleanup Guide

## What to update during an audit

- `CLEANUP_STATUS.md` (this repo)
- `CATALOG.md` / `skills_index.json` if structure changed

## Common junk to avoid

- Logs and output files committed by accident
- Temporary artifacts outside `Playground/` or `sandbox/` equivalents
