Welcome to your safe space for testing skills!

## 🏁 Try These First (The "Essentials")

Since you have the **Essentials** pack active, try these commands right here in this folder:

1.  **Plan a Task**
    > "Use **@concise-planning** to help me plan a python script that organizes my downloads folder."

2.  **Lint Code** (Create a quick dummy file first)
    > "Create a `test.js` with some messy code, then use **@lint-and-validate** to fix it."

3.  **Improve Your Process**
    > "Use **@kaizen** to review my current workflow for writing code."

## 📚 Where are the skills?
All skills are located in `../skills/`. You don't need to "run" them manually; just mention them by name (e.g., `@brainstorming`) in your chat with the agent.
